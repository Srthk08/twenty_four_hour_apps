## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Create Test Data
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Use: quick-cart-fix.sql
-- This creates the table and inserts test data
```

### Step 2: Test the Button
1. Go to your admin dashboard
2. Look for the "Cart Customizations" button in Quick Actions
3. Click the button
4. You should see a modal with cart data

### Step 3: Test Search
1. In the cart customizations modal
2. Type an email address in the search box
3. Results should filter in real-time

### Step 4: Check Summary Card
1. Look at the summary cards at the top
2. "Cart Customizations" card should show the count
3. Count should match the number of items in the modal

## üéØ Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Working Correctly:
- Button appears in Quick Actions section
- Modal opens when button is clicked
- Cart data displays in organized cards
- Search filters results by email
- Summary card shows correct count
- All data loads from Supabase

### ‚ùå If Not Working:

- Ensure RLS policies allow admin access
- Check if data exists in the table

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"No cart customizations found"** - Table exists but is empty
2. **Error loading data** - Check Supabase connection
3. **Button not working** - Check JavaScript console for errors
4. **Count shows 0** - Verify data exists in database

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click the Cart Customizations button
3. Look for error messages
4. Check network requests to Supabase
5. Verify table structure and data
