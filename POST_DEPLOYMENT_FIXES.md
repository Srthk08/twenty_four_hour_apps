# ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment Fixes Applied

## âœ… **Issues Fixed Successfully**

### **Problem 1: OMS Product Showing "Under Development" Popup**
**Issue:** When users clicked on the Order Menu System product, it was showing the same "under development" popup as other products.

**Root Cause:** The product access logic was checking for admin role first, but the OMS product should be accessible to all users regardless of login status.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `src/pages/products/index.astro`
- **Change:** Reordered the logic to check for OMS product access before admin check
- **Result:** OMS product now accessible to all users (logged in or not)

```javascript
// OLD LOGIC (causing the issue):
if (isAdmin) {
  // Allow access
} else if (productSlug !== 'order-menu-system') {
  // Show dialog
}

// NEW LOGIC (fixed):
if (isAdmin) {
  // Allow access
} else if (productSlug === 'order-menu-system') {
  // Allow OMS access for all users
} else {
  // Show dialog for other products
}
```

### **Problem 2: Auto-Refresh Redirecting to Home Page**
**Issue:** After showing the "under development" popup, the page was automatically redirecting users to the home page after 3 seconds.

**Root Cause:** The individual product page had an auto-redirect timer that was causing unwanted page refreshes.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `src/pages/products/[slug].astro`
- **Change:** Removed the auto-redirect timer
- **Result:** Users can now stay on the product page and close the dialog manually

```javascript
// OLD CODE (causing auto-redirect):
setTimeout(() => {
  window.location.href = '/products';
}, 3000);

// NEW CODE (fixed):
// Note: Removed auto-redirect to prevent page refresh issues
```

### **Problem 3: Non-Logged-In Users Can't View Products**
**Issue:** Users who weren't logged in couldn't access any products, including the Order Menu System.

**Root Cause:** The authentication check was too restrictive and was blocking access to OMS product.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `src/pages/products/index.astro`
- **Change:** Made OMS product accessible to all users regardless of authentication status
- **Result:** Non-logged-in users can now view and access the Order Menu System

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Behavior After Fixes:**

### **For Order Menu System:**
- âœ… **All users** (logged in or not) can view the product page
- âœ… **No popup** is shown when clicking "View Details"
- âœ… **No auto-redirect** occurs
- âœ… **Add to Cart** button works (redirects to login if not authenticated)

### **For Other Products:**
- âœ… **Admin users** can view all products without restrictions
- âœ… **Non-admin users** see the "under development" popup
- âœ… **No auto-redirect** - users can close the dialog and stay on the page
- âœ… **Order Menu System** is highlighted as available in the popup

### **For Non-Logged-In Users:**
- âœ… **Can view** Order Menu System product page
- âœ… **Cannot view** other product pages (shows popup)
